8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You discussed constraints, but not "check constraints". There is a
  difference. 

- Check for spelling. Proof read your writing.


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Very good!

Correct SQL statements
Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here




5. Show the names of customers who placed at least one order through an 
   agent in their own city, along with those agent(sâ€™) names.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.


7. Show the name and city of customers who live in the city that makes the 
   fewest different kinds of products. (Hint: Use count and group by on 
   the Products table.)

Incorrect query
- you are not checking that the city produces the fewest number of products




In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. 

- You droped my tables when I ran your file! I am a bit upset about that.

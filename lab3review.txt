Correct output for all queries
Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select *
  from products
  where city NOT IN('Dallas', 'Duluth')
  and priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city NOT IN ('Dallas', 'Duluth')
    AND priceUSD >= 1;



In general: 

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. You
  droped my tables when I ran your file! I am a bit upset about that.

1. 

Evidence looks ok.


2.

Excellent knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey.


3.

You did not discuss datatypes, and only mentioned what fields were -nullable-
but did not explain why.


4.

Good explanations about the rules. 

The ``all rows must be unique'' is right, but be careful, it does not make it
easy or hard to search data.
